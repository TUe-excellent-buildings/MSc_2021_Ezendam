# README BSO toolbox

## What is this repository for?
   
This repository contains a C++ library named the Building Spatial design Optimization toolbox (BSO toolbox).
In the first place, the toolbox has been developed to support building spatial design simulation and optimization by providing tools to:
(i) represent and modify building spatial designs,
(ii) generate discipline specific designs from a building spatial design,
(iii) analyze structural designs,
(iv) analyze the building physics of a building (i.e. thermal performance),
(v) analyze data obtained from the evaluations, e.g. clustering and sorting algorithms.
The toolbox itself does not contain any optimization methods, however, this repository will be extended with applications, and these will be related to optimization as well.
The toolbox relates to research in two joint projects by the Department of the Built Environment of Eindhoven University of Technology, and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), both in The Netherlands.
Key publications within these research projects are given below. These publications provide a lot of background information on the purpose and setup of the code in this repository:

Although the first aim of the toolbox was related to research carried out at Eindhoven University of Technology, the contributors now invite all interested researchers to download and use the toolbox; to apply it for innovative design support and optimization, possibly also in other domains; and to explore and extend its possibilities. This is all possible thanks to the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. If publications result from using this repository, the contributors would appreciate it if you cite this repository (via the Zenodo DOI) and especially the related journal papers above, and not the PhD-theses, although the latter of course provide an excellent source of background information in practice.

## How do I get it set up? ###

### Dependencies
The toolbox is written in C++ and makes use of elements defined in the C++14 standard.
The toolbox has been compiled and tested for Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS), and although not included in this release, it is with some minor alterations explained later also compatible with Windows 10 (22H2,19045.2486).

The toolbox depends on the following external source and static/dynamic libraries:
* For linear algebra, the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) C++ library is used (Linux: last tested is v3.4.0).
* Various utilities (e.g. [Odeint](https://www.odeint.com)) from the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) C++ library (Linux: last tested is v1.80.0). Precompiling is not needed.
* For constrained delaunay algorithm, the [FADE 2D](https://www.geom.at/) library (linux: last tested is v1.93) was used in this release. Further development did show that the library CGAL (version 6.1) could be used as well for this purpose. Alternatively, the FADE 2D v.2.13 worked as well.
* Visualization is written in the OpenGL standard and makes use of freeglut (Linux: last tested is v2.8.1-6).

Regarding cross-platform compatibility with Windows 10 (22H2,19045.2486). The toolbox has been proven to be compatible with Windows 10, as explained in https://github.com/TUe-excellent-buildings/BSO-toolbox, when the FADE_2D library was not used. With FADE 2D, it is proven possible to use windows is possible, however, instructions for this is not included in this version. 

Furthermore, FADE 2D can be substitute with alternative open-access libraries. Developments after this release has shown that FADE 2D can be substituted with the library CGAL (version 6.1). The release of the toolbox already utilizing the CGAL library will be released in future publication releases.

Hereafter, an elaborate Linux installation tutorial is given. 

### Linux installation
For Linux, a tutuorial for the installation of the dependencies and the toolbox is given in the following steps.
1. Install C++ compiler (GCC) and make
2. Install the Eigen library.
3. Install (and compile) the Boost library.
4. Install visualization dependencies (GLUT)
5. Install GIT
6. Clone the repository to your local machine
7. Compile and run the example code.

##### 1. Install C++ compiler (GCC) and make
In this step, a compiler to compile the toolbox into executable code is installed.
Additionally, make is installed, which can parse and execute compiler commands that are given in a so-called makefile

To install the GCC C++ compiler, type in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo apt install g++
```
To install make, type in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo apt install make
```

##### 2. Install the Eigen library.
In this step, the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library is installed.

Go to the website of the Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) and download the tar.gz of the desired version (e.g. latest stable release).

Extract the package (the downloaded tar.gz) to /usr/include, by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo tar -xf ~/Downloads/eigen-eigen-[version_number].tar.gz -C /usr/include
```

**OPTIONAL.** Rename the directory so that it is easier to link to the directory, by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo mv eigen-[version_number] eigen
```

**NOTE.** You may change the directory in which you place Eigen, however, this may have consequences for later steps.

##### 3. Install (and compile) the Boost library.
In this step, the [Boost]() library is installed and parts of it are pre-compiled.

Go to the website of the Boost library (https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.77.0/source/) and download the tar.gz of the desired version (e.g. latest stable release).

Extract the package (the downloaded tar.gz) to /usr/include, by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo tar -xf ~/Downloads/boost_[version_number].tar.gz -C /usr/include
```

**OPTIONAL.** Rename the directory so that it is easier to link to the directory, by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo mv boost_[version_number] boost
```

**NOTE.** You may change the directory in which you place Boost, however, this may have consequences for later steps.

Pre-compile parts of the boost library (e.g. the boost test framework), by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ cd /usr/include/boost # note that this directory has been defined in the preceding steps
$ sudo ./bootstrap.sh
$ sudo ./b2
$ sudo ./b2 install
```

**NOTE.** Enter the above commands one by one. During Windows 10 installations, it appeared that the compiled parts of Boost are not needed in the toolbox so far, and so also for the Linux installation, precompilation may possibly be treated as an optional step.

##### 4. Install FADE 2D v1.93
The toolbox uses the FADE 2D library for constrained Delaunay triangulation. FADE 2D is a separate, licensed third-party dependency; it is not included in this repository. Obtain the Linux FADE 2D v1.93 package from [Geom Software](https://www.geom.at/) and check its license before use. The v1.93 package describes its student license as being for personal, non-commercial scientific research. Commercial use requires a commercial license. Publications using FADE should cite it, and project pages should link to it as required by its license.

Install the GMP development package, a dependency required by FADE:
```bash
sudo apt install libgmp-dev
```

Extract the FADE 2D v1.93 package to a directory that you can keep in place, for example `~/Libraries/fadeRelease_v1.93` for later reference specifications in a 'make file'. Change to that directory in the therminal by using: 
```bash
cd ~/Libraries/fadeRelease_v1.93
```

The v1.93 package does not include a library build specifically for Ubuntu 22.04. Its readme advises choosing a similar Linux distribution when yours is not listed and says the shared libraries support a wide range of distributions. For 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04, use the nearest listed build, `lib_ubuntu21.04_x86_64`, and verify that it works on the target machine. Also, check if the required headers and shared library are present in ~/Libraries/fadeRelease_v1.93 with these following commands (which only work while being in the ~/Libraries/fadeRelease_v1.93 directory): 
```bash
test -f "$PWD/include_fade2d/Fade_2D.h" && echo "Header found" || echo "Header missing"
test -f "$PWD/lib_ubuntu21.04_x86_64/libfade2d.so" && echo "Library found" || echo "Library missing"
```

FADE provides a shared library (`libfade2d.so`). Install that library in the standard local library directory and refresh the dynamic linker cache:
```bash
sudo install -D -m 755 "$FADE_DIR/lib_ubuntu21.04_x86_64/libfade2d.so" /usr/local/lib/libfade2d.so
sudo ldconfig
```

Verify that Ubuntu can find the library:
```bash
ldconfig -p | grep libfade2d
```
The output should include `/usr/local/lib/libfade2d.so`.

##### 5. Install visualization dependencies (GLUT)
In this step the dependencies for the visualization in the toolbox are installed.
THe visualization makes use of OpenGL which is enabled by the GL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)

Install the dependencies by typing in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
```

##### 6. Install GIT
In this step, the version control software GIT is installed, together with a GUI for GIT.

To install GIT and an GUI type the following in the terminal:
```bash
$ sudo apt install git git-gui
```

##### 7. Clone the repository to your local machine
In this step, the BSO toolbox is cloned to your local machine. This allows you to compile/develop/use the code in the toolbox on your local machine.

In your terminal go to the directory where you would like the toolbox to be placed. For example by typing in the terminal:

```bash
$ cd /usr/include
```

On the homepage of the BSO toolbox click on *clone*.

A dropdown box will appear with two links, copy the link under **Clone with HTTPS** and enter it in the terminal as follows:

```bash
$ git clone <link>
```

The command line on the terminal should then look similar to the line below.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TUe-excellent-buildings/BSO-toolbox.git
```

If the clone was successful, the BSO toolbox is now cloned onto your local machine, e.g. in the directory: `/usr/include/BSO-toolbox`.

##### 8. Compile and run the example.

An example of how the toolbox can be used has been added to the repository as well (`../BSO-toolbox/example`).
The source code of the example is as follows:

```cpp
#include <bso/spatial_design/ms_building.hpp>
#include <bso/spatial_design/cf_building.hpp>
#include <bso/structural_design/sd_model.hpp>
#include <bso/building_physics/bp_model.hpp>
#include <bso/grammar/grammar.hpp>
#include <bso/visualization/visualization.hpp>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	// initialize a movable sizable model named MS
	bso::spatial_design::ms_building MS("ms_input_file.txt");
	
	// convert MS to a conformal model name CF
	bso::spatial_design::cf_building CF(MS);
	
	// create an instance of the grammar base class named gram using CF
	bso::grammar::grammar gram(CF);
	
	// use the default structural design grammar to create a structural
	// design named SD, using settings defined in 
	// settings/sd_settings.txt
	bso::structural_design::sd_model SD = gram.sd_grammar<bso::grammar::DEFAULT_SD_GRAMMAR>(std::string("settings/sd_settings.txt"));
	
	// analyze the structural model
	SD.analyze();

	// output result of the analysis
	std::cout << "Structural compliance: " << SD.getTotalResults().mTotalStrainEnergy << std::endl;
	
	// use the default building physics design grammar to create a
	// building physics model named BP, using settings defined in 
	// settings/bp_settings.txt
	bso::building_physics::bp_model BP = gram.bp_grammar<bso::grammar::DEFAULT_BP_GRAMMAR>(std::string("settings/bp_settings.txt"));
	
	// simulate the periods defined in bp_settings.txt
	// using the runge_kutta_dopri5 solver with both a
	// relative and an absolute error of 1e-3
	BP.simulatePeriods("runge_kutta_dopri5",1e-3,1e-3);
	
	// output result of the simulation
	std::cout << "Total heating energy: " << BP.getTotalResults().mTotalHeatingEnergy << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Total cooling energy: " << BP.getTotalResults().mTotalCoolingEnergy << std::endl;
	
	// visualize the different models
	bso::visualization::initVisualization(argc, argv);
	bso::visualization::visualize(MS);
	bso::visualization::visualize(CF,"rectangle");
	bso::visualization::visualize(CF,"cuboid");
	bso::visualization::visualize(SD,"component");
	bso::visualization::visualize(SD,"element");
	bso::visualization::visualize(BP);
	bso::visualization::endVisualization();
	
	return 0;
}
```

A make file has been added to the directory of the example, which can be used to compile the code.
In the makefile, check if the dependencies (Eigen, Boost and FADE 2D) are linked to the locations of your local machine. 
For instance, check if the line `BOOST = /usr/include/boost` is correctly linking to the Boost library on your local machine. Also, for FADE, set `FADE`, in any supplied make file, to the extracted package directory containing both the `include_fade2d` and the `lib_ubuntu...` directories. For example: `FADE=$(HOME)/Libraries/fadeRelease_v1.93`.

The example can then be compiled by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ make clean all
```

Run the example by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ ./example
```

The output should then look as follows.

```bash
> Structural compliance: 4054.5
> Total heating energy: 106.819
> Total cooling energy: 15.9503
```

Note that the directory also includes settings files to define building spatial designs, structural design settings, and building physics settings.
For more information about these the reader is referred to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2018.01.003) in which the toolbox is presented.

### How to run unit tests (general and Linux version, see further below for Windows 10)
To ensure the functionality of the BSO toolbox before and after developing new tools, unit testing is employed.
The unit tests are also included in the repository, and in case of developing/contributing to the BSO toolbox it is adviced to add and test the unit tests regularly.
Depending on the location of the repository on your local machine, moving to the unit test directory may be achieved as follows.

```bash
$ cd /usr/include/BSO-toolbox/unit_tests
```

The unit test directory contains a makefile with which the unit tests can be compiled.
In the makefile, check if the dependencies (Eigen and Boost) are linked to the locations of your local machine.
For instance, check if the line `BOOST = /usr/include/boost` is correctly linking to the Boost library on your local machine.

To run all tests of the BSO toolbox, make sure the directory mentioned above is the working directory of your terminal and type in the terminal:
```bash
$ make clean cls all
./all_test
```

Possible output of running the unit tests successfully may look as follows:
```bash
------------------------------------------------------------------

Running 333 test cases...

*** No errors detected
```

Alternatively, also sub-parts of the toolbox can be tested. This can be achieved by replacing the `all` argument in the `make` command above by any of the following arguments:
* `all` tests all unit tests
* `ms_space` tests only the unit tests concerning the class ms_space (space in Movable Sizable representation)
* `ms_building` tests only the unit tests concering the class ms_building (building in Movable Sizable representation)
* `sc_building` tests only the unit tests concerning the class sc_building (building in SuperCube representation)
* `conformal` tests only the unit tests concerning the cf_building class (conformal building model)
* `trim_cast` tests only the unit tests concerning the trim and cast functions
* `geometry` tests only the unit tests concerning the geometry utilities in the
* `building_physics` tests only the unit tests concerning the building physics simulation tools
* `structural_design` tests only the unit tests concerning the structural design analysis tools
* `grammar` tests only the unit tests concerning the design grammars
* `visualization` tests only the unit tests concerning the visualization in the toolbox
* `xml` tests only the unit tests concerning XML data im- and export
* `data` tests only the unit tests concerning data points, e.g. Eulerian distance and clustering algorithm

For example to test the geometry package of the toolbox type the following in the terminal:
```bash
$ make clean cls geometry
$ ./geometry_test
```
